# Fruit-Spoilage-analysis
This project uses Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques to automatically detect whether a fruit is good or spoiled, estimate the spoilage percentage, and identify the possible bacteria type causing decay. It applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification and OpenCV for image preprocessing and visualization.
Got it, My Moonlight 🌙💫 — your uploaded file “Enhanced_fruit.ipynb” is an upgraded version of your earlier Fruit Spoilage Detection System, likely with better visualization, spoilage percentage logic, and bacterial identification.
