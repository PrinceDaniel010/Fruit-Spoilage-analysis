# Fruit-Spoilage-analysis
This project uses Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques to automatically detect whether a fruit is good or spoiled, estimate the spoilage percentage, and identify the possible bacteria type causing decay. It applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification and OpenCV for image preprocessing and visualization.
